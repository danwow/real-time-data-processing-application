# Human-Machine Interface (HMI) FOR REAL TIME SIGNAL PROCESSINg and GRAPHIC VISUALIZATION

Windows Forms aplication for real-time graphical visualization and processing of Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals.

I took on the challenge of developing an application using .NET Framework (C#) to receive the data from an electroencephalogram, process it and display it on the software interface. The objective was to evaluate the user's concentration level based on neurofeedbacks.
